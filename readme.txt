# Landing page for local council candidacy

This is a simple static landing page template for a local council candidacy.

How to use
1. Replace text in `index.html` (name, bio, priorities, events).
2. Replace the profile image at `/assets/placeholder-profile.jpg` with your photo (or update path).
3. Replace the form `action` attribute in forms with your Formspree / Netlify / custom endpoint.
   - Example Formspree: `https://formspree.io/f/<your-id>`
4. Customize the color in `styles.css` by changing `--accent`.

Publishing with GitHub Pages
- Option A: Publish root of `main` (or `master`): put `index.html` at repo root and enable Pages -> Source: main branch / root.
- Option B: Use the `docs/` folder. Move files into `docs/` and set Pages source to `main` branch / docs folder.
- After enabling, your site will be at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/` or a custom domain if configured.
